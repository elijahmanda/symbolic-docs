Welcome to Symbolic Language's Documentation!
=============================================

**Symbolic Language** is an interpreted, dynamically-typed programming language tailored for advanced computational tasks across various domains, including mathematics, science, and engineering. It features concise syntax, lazy evaluation, and modular design, enabling developers to create complex systems efficiently and elegantly.

Explore this documentation to learn about the language's syntax, features, and advanced concepts, and to see examples that demonstrate its capabilities.

Features of Symbolic Language:
- **Dynamic Typing**: Flexible handling of variable types.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Evaluate expressions only when needed.
- **Advanced Control Flow**: Support for conditional statements, loops, and match-case constructs.
- **Modular Design**: Easily organize and reuse code across projects.
- **Domain-Specific Libraries**: Built-in support for scientific and mathematical computations.

.. note::

   Symbolic Language is under active development. Contributions and feedback are welcome! See the **Contributing** section for details.

Quick Start
===========

Want to dive right in? Here's a simple example:

.. code-block:: symbolic

   # Define a function to calculate factorial
   fn factorial(n) {
       if n <= 1 {
           return 1;
       } else {
           return n * factorial(n - 1);
       }
   }

   # Call the function
   print(factorial(5));  # Output: 120
