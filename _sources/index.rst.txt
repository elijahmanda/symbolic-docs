Welcome to Symbolic Language's Documentation!
=============================================

**Symbolic Language** is an interpreted, dynamically-typed programming language designed for both general-purpose programming and advanced AI applications. It is ideal for creating AI assistants, chatbots, and smart systems, as well as for tackling complex computational tasks in mathematics, science, and engineering. With a concise syntax, modular design, and high-level abstractions, Symbolic offers a flexible environment for developers to build intelligent systems and efficient software.


Features of Symbolic Language:
--------------------------------
- **Dynamic Typing**: Flexible handling of variable types.
- **Concise Syntax**: Write clean and readable code with minimal effort.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Evaluate expressions only when needed.
- **Advanced Control Flow**: Support for conditional statements, loops, and match-case constructs.
- **Precision-Aware Computations**: Handle numeric operations with adjustable precision.
- **AI and General-Purpose Libraries**: Built-in support for AI tasks, mathematical computations, string manipulation, and more.
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrate Symbolic with other systems and tools.

.. note::

   Symbolic Language is under active development. Contributions and feedback are welcome! See the **Contributing** section for details.

Quick Start
===========

Want to dive right in? Here's a simple example:

.. code-block:: symbolic

   # Define a function to calculate factorial
   fn factorial(n) {
       if n <= 1 {
           return 1;
       } else {
           return n * factorial(n - 1);
       }
   }

   # Call the function
   print(factorial(5));  # Output: 120
